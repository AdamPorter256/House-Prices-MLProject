# House Price Data - Machine learning Project
This machine learning project seeks insight into housing price data in the US, addressing multiple hypotheses and making predictions. This is my first machine learning project, so I will be detailing throughout the challenges faced and my approach to dealing with them.
# Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project can be found on kaggle through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/housing-price-dataset

The dataset provides details on houses in the US between the years 2014 and 2015. Due to the small time range of records it is not possible to examine the impact of changes to this variable, however we may wish to keep this as a predictive variable since it will still have an influence on house prices, even if it is small.
# Libraries Used
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
