# House-Prices-MLProject
This machine learning project seeks insight into housing price data in the US, addressing multiple hypotheses and making predictions. This is my first machine learning project, so I will be detailing throughout the challenges faced and my approach to dealing with them.
The dataset used for this project can be found on kaggle through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/housing-price-dataset
